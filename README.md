PWL: the Poorly Worded License
==============================

I was complaining how poorly worded a free-ish license was when a thought occurred: might not poor wording be good strategy?  Hear me out:

 - Who are the people who worry about whether a license is watertight?
   - The juicy targets with assets to protect
   - Aggregators who don't want to expose their users to risk
 - The juicy targets, I'm positively excited to find a way to make them nervous
 - The aggregators, in the old days (5 years ago) I'd have seen this as a critical flaw. Debian definitely wouldn't be into a poorly worded license. But there are a lot more seat-of-the-pants aggregators these days, not naming names, who don't actually worry too much about the fine legal details.

So a poorly worded license could work.
